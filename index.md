## Introduction and background 

### Vehicle plate recognition system: 

The vehicle plate recognition system is used to recognize the vehicle plate number and store the information for parking charging.
### Background: 
The vehicle plate number recognition system is still limited and has low efficiency when handling cases, which includes but is not limited to event parking, regular permit parking illegal parking. This incapability often will incur the congestion of the main traffic route and increase the risk of traffic incidents. In order to improve the correctness of plate recognition and thus improve the vehicle throughput, we need a better model to handle the plate recognition and save unit labor cost.

## Methodology

 The dataset we will utilize is based on images of vehicle plates. To handle the influence of a variety of plates, the influence of different weather, lighting conditions, and the angle between the camera and the plate objects, at the very first step, we include the 53 images of plates from 50 States in America and 433 images of plates under different lighting conditions. 400 of these images will be served as the training dataset, and 33 of these images will be served as the test part. <br>We will consider each image as each data point and the features are the RGB color space and XY coordinates. Also, we will consider the testing part of the neural network as the target, which is also the goal that the model is aiming for. The target also includes the raw image data processing, which contains the processing of raw environments and angles from which the images were taken. Basically, the images were treated the same way as the training data, which is to be binarized and tiled to the same angle for the neural network to identify the plate number. The images include the plates with backgrounds like parking lots and traffic scenes.  We might also need to include more image datasets in the future if needed to encounter emerging challenges. The dataset is obtained through roboflow.com and Kaggle.com for academic purposes. Each image in the datasets has already been preprocessed, zipped and according cropped to be identical image size and small enough for training efficiency. In addition to the process data, we also have done dimensional reduction to make the image data small enough for fast iteration and processing. The dimensions for the raw image data are five, which are the RGB color space and the XY coordinates. By dimensional reduction, we have done binarization to the data, which abandons the RGB color space and only keeps the XY coordinates to retain the original image information to the greatest extent, which is only the plate number.<div align=center>

</div><br> Further, we utilized the methods of unsupervised learning like Kmeans, DBSCAN, and GMM methods for us to better understand the datasets. For example, we need the unsupervised learning method to make clusters for us to better choose the right area, which contains vehicle plates. We might also incorporate pure plates for the supervised learning part to increase the detection accuracy further.<br> The process will be divided into two parts to guarantee the performance of the recognition model, which are the training part and the test part. In the training dataset, we will train the model based on the label for each plate image. The test dataset mainly serves as the evaluation of the performance for the successful recognition rate. The new feature we will include in this project will be the involvement of deep learning technology. In the past decades, the vehicle plate recognition system is mainly based on the preprocessing of the captured plate images and identifying each character based on the character database. However, with the help of the deep learning method and enormous datasets, the process efficiency and correctness will be dramatically improved. The potential risk for this method includes failing to find a hyper parameter set to make the time cost in a reasonable range, and failing to improve the overall recognition rate based on the limited training and testing datasets at hand. It also might increase the data search and fetching budget to meet these accuracy criteria. A reasonable budget will include the usage of GPU with high performance and time searching for useful datasets. The basic estimate time for each epoch varies based on the size of each batch of datasets, and the configuration of each hyper parameter. It can range from several minutes to several hours to complete this task.



## Results

The expected result of the vehicle plate recognition system will be highly efficient and capable of handling a large amount of vehicle throughput in a short period of time. According to the GA/T 497-2004 and GA/T 497-2009 standards, the detection precision has to be higher than 90% during the daytime and higher than 80% during the nighttime. The expected accuracy for this model is at least 85% with mixed light conditions. We will also include two checkpoints for this project process, which are the midterm check and the final check. The midterm check will include the check for the sufficient dataset and the recognition rate. If the result is under the expectation, we need to reconfigure the process or need to optimize the model in order to achieve better performance. The final exam will check whether the efficiency and accuracy of the recognition requirement are met.

### Discussion
 
The success of the project will greatly reduce labor costs and reduce expenditures. The successful deployment of the model will greatly improve the vehicle throughput capacity of the parking lot per unit time and reduce the traffic congestion due to waiting in and out of the queue, thereby reducing the probability of traffic accidents near the gate.
